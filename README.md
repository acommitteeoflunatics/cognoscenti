## Cognoscenti


Cognoscenti traditionally and historically means "those who know".

In our desired paradigm, Cognoscenti /kägnəˈSentē/ is a secure, yet simple, automated VPN solution developed for remote employees in small to medium offices. It uses a specific combination of hardware and software resources to create an encrypted network link between the remote users current network and the office network he wishes to perform work on remotely. Once setup for the client device is completed at the office, simply connect the client device to a wired or wireless network wherever you desire to work from. Cognoscenti "knows" how to do the rest. Featuring robust security and drop-in simplicity, Cognoscenti promises to keep your data flowing between you and your office with peace of mind allowing you to concentrate on the work that needs doing.
