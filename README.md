## Cognoscenti


Cognoscenti traditionally and historically means "those who know".

In our desired paradigm, Cognoscenti /kägnəˈSentē/ is a secure, yet simple, automated VPN solution developed for remote employees in small to medium offices. It uses a specific combination of hardware and software resources to create an encrypted network link between the remote users current network and the office network he wishes to perform work on remotely.
